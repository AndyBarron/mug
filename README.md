# Mug
Fun & functional\* programming language, implemented with Jison and NodeJS\*\*.

## Features
* Beautiful\*\*\* syntax
* First-class functions
* Closures

## Setup
To run the current interpreter, you first need to install NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/).

Then install Jison (https://zaach.github.io/jison/) locally with NPM: `npm install jison`

The `mug.js` interpreter will use Jison to rebuild the parser (based on `mug.jison`) whenever it's run.

## Usage
To run the REPL: `node mug.js`

To interpret a `.mug` file: `node mug.js path/to/file`

## Example
See `example.mug` in the top level of the repo!

## Upcoming Features
* Loops (heh)
* Moving to something faster than NodeJS (maybe)

##
\* Get it?  
\*\* I know, I know...  
\*\*\* Purely my opinion.
